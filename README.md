# task-friction-tracker
Streamlit app that tracks planned and actual task completion time to help users identify difficult transitions.

# Project MVP:	

1. Working streamlit application, ready to be shown to someone right away

2. What can be cut: extra features

3. MVP features: 
  - User can define a routine/task: Create 1+ task/routine and persists across sessions
  - User can log task instance: Intended completion time, actual completion
  - App stores and retrieves history (persistence)
  - App shows 1+ summary: Completion time, average energy per task. Text or chart. Overall summary sentence optional

# Keywords:
friction = task not completed
  
# Intended audience
Neurodivergent users who rely on routines but experience variable energy, sensory load, and executive functioning that make rigid planners fail.

# Function
Lets users log routines/tasks with simple signals (completion, energy, time of day) 

# Core value
Detects patterns of friction over time (e.g., tasks succeed more at certain times or energy levels).

# AI usage
Uses basic analytics/clustering and rules to personalize insights and gentle schedule suggestions. Does not use LLMs.
